Plume’s main sailing ground includes the San Francisco Bay and Delta, as well as
the nearby Pacific Ocean from Bodega Bay to Monterey. The region has
breathtaking scenery, strong currents, and hazardous weather. So sailing is
always interesting! Pictures can be found at

Aboard Plume, our family of three spent two years sailing 3,360 nautical miles
from the United States to Mexico. Our route followed the West Coast of
California, down the length of Baja, through the calm waters of the Sea of
Cortez, and along the lively shores of mainland Mexico. Pictures can be found at

## 2001-2002: Plume's Construction

Plume was built at the Nor'Sea Yachts boatshop in Ontario, California. We bought
her as a Kit boat #3, which included the hull, deck, main cabinetry, and
standing rigging. In addition, we hired the factory carpenter for the complex
work requiring true craftsmanship. Everything else was left for us to do, like
painting, trimming, plumbing, electricity, and deck equipment. We spent many
weekends down at the boatshop in Ontario to work on the boat while the kit was
being built. That way we benefited from the boatshop's tools and expertise. It
was hard work but we learned a bunch!

## 2002: Plume's Splash & First Sailings

Plume was splashed at Grand Marina (Alameda, CA) on April 12th 2002, six months
after the beginning of her construction. 

Even though we had many projects left on our to-do list, we started sailing her
in the San Francisco Bay. Here is a

of Plume's very first adventures on the water.

## 2003: Plume's First Taste of the Pacific Ocean

During our honeymoon, we took Plume outside the San Francisco Bay for the first
time. After crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, the journey took us north to Drakes
Bay (near Point Reyes) and Bodega Bay, then south to Monterey, and finally back
home via Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay.

## 2008-2010: Plume's Voyage to Mexico

In 2008, we decided to quit our jobs and go cruising. Before the trip, we both
spent three months working full time on the boat to complete most projects left
on our to-do list. Once about ready, and with our four-year old son, we left San
Francisco and started a two-year and journey of 3,360 nautical miles, including
65 days and 30 nights on the water as well as 46 stops. The journey took us
along the busy and cold coast of California, the wild coast of Baja California
in Mexico, the beautiful Sea of Cortez, and finally the lively west coast of
mainland Mexico between San Carlos and La Cruz. At the end of the journey, we
trailed Plume back to San Francisco via road on a brand new trailer. Preparing
for such a journey is a lot of work, and being three people on 27 feet can be a
challenge at times. But the experience is worth all the effort. It was a
wonderful family adventure!

There is also a [video](https://photos.flupes.org/Public/Plume/Sabbatical/Video/i-6VdXRLw/A) and a [slide deck](/assets/media/other/PlumeSabbaticalSmall.pdf) that were presented at the
So-Cal Nor'Sea 27 Get-Together in May 2011.

## 2020: Plume's Refresh

In 2020 Plume turned 18 years old, so we decided to give her a little refresh! We
looked at every element and system from bow to stern in order to identify needs
for repair or replacement.


As a result, Plume has a new mainsail, standing and running rigging, main and
storm anchors, chain, VHF, GPS, AIS transponder, computer and navigation
station, depth sounder, main cabin cushions (super comfortable for
both sitting and sleeping), canvas for hatch and companionways, galley sole, and
more. The engine and stove were thoroughly serviced. For our stove however, the
service morphed into a replacement after it was badly damaged during shipping.
Since the responsibility of the accident was shared between Scan Marine and
ourselves, they agreed to send us another used replacement stove. So basically,
we have a new old stove! Those are just a few examples of the many repairs and
replacements completed during this extensive refresh.

## 2020-2025: California Sailing

During the summer of 2020, our plan was to trailer Plume to Canada and sail in
British Columbia. The project was canceled because of Covid-19. Instead, we
downgraded our dreams and continued
[sailing in California](https://photos.flupes.org/Public/Plume/SailingCA).

Meanwhile, to keep Plume in Bristol condition, we kept up with [maintenance and
upgrades]({{site.baseurl}}/projects), with new 80% jib, prop, and batteries,
along with other [improvements]({{site.baseurl}}/blog) to ensure she stays ready
for the miles ahead.
