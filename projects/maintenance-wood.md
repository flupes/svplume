## Yearly Exterior Teakwood Maintenance

When it comes to teakwood maintenance, we first tried teak oil: It was easy to
apply, but did not last or effectively protect the wood.

Second, we tried [varnish (Bristol Finish)](/2006/new-paint/): The teak looked
amazing, but it was way too much work.

Eventually, and since 2011, we adopted a solution that works for us:
[Cetol Marine Natural Teak](https://www.interlux.com/en/us/boat-paint/varnish/cetol-marine-natural-teak).
It makes yearly maintenance manageable with only 2 to 3 coats and no sanding
between coats. It nicely protects the wood and the result looks almost as good
as varnish... although it does not have its beautiful glossy finish.

### Material

- Sikkens Cetol Marine Natural Teak (1 quart)
- Interlux Special Thinner 216 (cleaning solvent)

- Paint cup (large enough for the 3'' sponge brush)
- Sand paper: Mostly 220-320 grit (e.g. 3M Pro Grade Precision 220 Grit Fine
  Ultra Flexible Sanding Roll) including one angle sanding block; A couple of
  sheets of 100-150 grit to deal with problematic areas; One 3M Scotch Brite
  brown pad to use between coats
- Tape: Delicate Surface 3M Blue or FROGTAPE Yellow (quantity for 2-3 coats: 2x
  1.8'' large, 1x 1.4'' medium, 1x 1'' small)
- Tack cloth (one per coat)
- Paint stick

### Preparation

Prepare the deck by removing anything in the way, like lifelines, spinnaker
pole, anchor, and hardware as needed.

### Day 1: Sanding 

*Duration: 6 hours for all the exterior teak except hatches (add a maximum of 1
hour per hatch)*

Use 220-320 grit paper to lightly sand the teak with a goal of only removing the
gloss (i.e. without going back to the wood unless there is a local problem). A
flexible paper is best for round shapes and could be used with an angle sanding
block on flat surfaces; angles help avoid damaging adjacent surfaces.

### Day 2: Taping 

*Duration: 6 hours*

Carefully align the tape to the wood while leaving a tiny space between the two
in order to allow the Cetol to attach to the surface around the wood.

### Day 3: Coat 1

*Duration: 3 hours*

Remove any dust by cleaning the surfaces adjacent to the wood with a soft
cleaning sponge and the wood itself with Interlux Special Thinner 216. Once all
is dry, apply one coat of Cetol Marine Natural Teak. A few tips:
- Keep a tack cloth handy to remove any dust as you go. 
- Avoid painting the same surface twice while keeping a wet edge to prevent lap
  marks.
- In Northern California in June, we typical apply the coat between 9:00am (the
  deck should be dry) and noon (the job should be completed before the wood gets
  too hot).
- We prefer cheap disposable sponge brushes versus expensive bristle brushes
  requiring being cleaned with thinners that are damaging to people's health and
  the environment. Note, however, that a good quality bristle brush leads to a nicer finish, especially on large surfaces.

### Day 4: Coat 2

*Duration: 3 hours*

Inspect the previous coat and remove any insects or other debris with the 3M
Scotch Brite brown pad. Then repeat what was done for coat 1.

---

Repeat Day 4 if a third coat is needed. Remove the tape right after the last coat. 

Let Cetol cure for about one week before returning sailing. In the meantime,
work on the [deck's gelcoat](/projects/maintenance-gelcoat), [deck's stainless steel](/projects/maintenance-steel) and
[topsides' paint](/projects/maintenance-topsides) and put the deck back
together.
