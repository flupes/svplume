## Anchoring System

### Main Anchor

Since 2002, our primary anchor has been a Spade A80 aluminum model. It weighs just 15 lbs but has a surface large enough to hold boats up to 34 ft. It quickly became our favorite: light enough that even CÃ©cile can raise it, yet extremely reliable. Over the years it never once let us down. So when the time came to replace it in 2020, the choice was obvious: we went straight for the exact same model. It is set up with 120 ft of chain plus 150 ft of line, for a total of 270 ft.

### Storm Anchor

In addition, we carry a storm anchor just in case, a M2 Mantus of 35 lbs. It holds boats up to 30 ft in winds greater than 50 kn. It is easy to store as it breaks down into small parts. A single bolt is used for disassembly and storage. Ours is securely fixed to the cabin sole, yet easily removable, as shown in the pictures below.

### Stern Anchor

Finally, we also carry a Fortress stern anchor as a secondary anchor deployed from the rear of the boat to improve stability and reduce rolling in certain anchorage conditions.
