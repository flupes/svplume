### Yearly Topsides Maintenance 

The gelcoat on Plume's topsides was originally navy blue with a cream stripe. Unfortunately, with zero gelcoat maintenance during several years, the navy blue eventually started to show signs of oxidation. Hence we decided to get the topsides repainted by a boat yard. We reversed the colors, hoping that a light color will last longer and generate
less heat inside the boat (both turned-out to be correct). The boat yard used a linear polyurethane (AWLGRIP). Here is how we maintain it once a year.

### Step 1: Wash

*Duration: 1/2 hour per side*

**Material**
- [AWLGRIP Awlwash](https://www.awlgrip.com/products/boatcare/awlwash): 1 ounce (30 ml) of Awlwash per each gallon (3.785 liters) of waters
- Soft (non abrasive) sponge
- Chamois (or soft cotton towel)

**Application**
- Rinse the surface thoroughly prior to washing.
- Wash surface while still wet using a soft sponge. Do not allow Awlwash to dry on the surface prior to rinsing. Wash small sections of large surfaces to insure the surface stays wet. Rinse after washing. 
- Wipe with chamois to prevent water spots.

### Step 2: Protect

*Duration: 2 hour per side*

**Material**
- [AWLGRIP Awlcare](https://www.awlgrip.com/products/boatcare/awlcare) (protective polymer sealer)
- 100% cotton applicator or cloth

**Application**
- Shake Awlcare well and apply with a 100% cotton applicator or cloth (can be applied in sun or shade and to large areas before removing).
- Wipe off haze with a clean cotton cloth.
