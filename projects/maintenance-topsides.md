Plume's topsides were originally dark blue with cream stripe.

Secondly, we had the Plume’s topsides repainted by a boat yard. The original
gelcoat was showing signs of oxidation. This is probably due to a lack of
maintenance from our part (our experience with a varnished plywood/epoxy hull
made us thought that fiberglass was maintenance free!). 

Anyway, it was time for
a refresh and since we could choose any color we wanted, we decided to reverse
Plume’s original colors. This was a tough decision because we loved our Blue
Boat. However, we are hoping that a light color will last longer and generate
less heat inside the boat if we go farther south. 

The boat yard did an excellent
job and Plume has now beautiful cream topsides with a navy stripe. They used a linear polyurethane (AWLGRIP) that is
supposed to last much longer than gelcoat and require less maintenance as well.
