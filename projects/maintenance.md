## Teakwood
When it comes to teakwood maintenance, we first tried teak oil: It was easy to apply, but did not last or effectively protect the wood. Second, we tried varnish: The teak looked amazing, but it was way too much work. Eventually, and since 2011, we adopted a solution that works for us: Cetol Natural Teak (https://www.interlux.com/en/us/boat-paint/varnish/cetol-marine-natural-teak). It makes yearly maintenance manageable, nicely protects the wood, and the result looks almost as good as varnish...although it does not have its beautiful glossy finish. 

Number of coats: 2 to 3

Material:
- Interlux Cetol Natural Teak (1 quart)
- Interlux Special Thinner 216 (cleaning solvent)
- Paint cup (large enough for the 3'' sponge brush)
- Sponge brushes (quantity per coat: 2x 3'' large, 2x 2'' medium, 1x 1'' small -- the sponges from Ace Hardware work well)
- Sand paper: Mostly 220-320 grit (e.g. 3M Pro Grade Precision 220 Grit Fine Ultra Flexible Sanding Roll) including one angle sanding block. A couple of sheets of 100-150 grit to deal with problematic areas. One 3M Scotch Brite brown pad to use between coats.
- Tape: Delicate Surface 3M Blue or FROGTAPE Yellow (quantity for 2-3 coats: 2x 1.8'' large, 1x 1.4'' medium, 1x 1'' small)
- Tack cloth (one per coat)- Cotton rags
- Soft cleaning sponge- Trash bags

Prepare the deck by removing anything in the way, like lifelines, spinnaker pole, anchor, and hardware as needed.

### Day 1: Sanding 

*Duration: 6 hours for all the exterior teak except hatches (add a maximum of 1 hour per hatch).*

Use 220-320 grit paper to lightly sand the teak with a goal of removing all gloss. A flexible paper is best for round shapes and could be used with angle sanding blocks on flat surfaces; angles help avoid damaging adjacent surfaces.

### Day 2: Taping Duration: 

*6 hours*

Carefully align the tape to the wood while leaving a tiny space between the two in order to allow the Cetol to attach to the surface around the wood.

### Day 3: Coat 1

*Duration: 3 hours*

Remove any dust by cleaning the surface adjacent to the wood with a soft cleaning sponge and the wood itself with Interlux Special Thinner 216. Once all is dry, apply one coat of Interlux Cetol Natural Teak (use a tack cloth to remove dust as you go). Avoid painting the same surface twice while keeping a wet edge to prevent lap marks. We prefer cheap disposable sponge brushes versus expensive bristle brushes requiring thinners that are damaging to health and the environment.


### Day 4: Coat 2

*Duration: 3 hours*

Inspect the previous coat and remove any insects or other debris with the 3M Scotch Brite brown pad. Then repeat what was done for coat 1. 
Repeat Day 4 if you need a third coat. Remove the tape right after the last coat. Let Cetol cure for about one week before returning sailing. In the meantime, work on the projects below.
