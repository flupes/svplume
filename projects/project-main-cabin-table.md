### Main Cabin Table and Cushions 

Plumeâ€™s original table was generously sized, making it easy to seat four or five people, which was perfect when we had guests. However, it also occupied much of the cabin space, and lowering it to convert into a berth proved cumbersome as it involved removing a metal pole supporting the table.

To make life on board easier, we decided to cut the table into two sections. The forward part stays down at all times (with no need for a supporting pole), giving us a cozy spot to sit back, relax, or play. The aft part slides smoothly up and down the compression post: raised, it becomes a small table just right for three or four people; lowered, it turns the cabin into a spacious berth.

To accommodate the new table design, we first adapted Plume's original cushions as best as we could (see pictures above). They worked for a while, but eventually we swapped them out for professionally made ones that fit the berth perfectly and are super comfortable.

The space under the forward part of the permanently lowered table has been converted into [storage for our storm anchor]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project-anchors).
