### Yearly Deck Gelcoat Maintenance 

*Duration: 1/2 day*

**Material**
- 3M Finesse-It II Finishing Material
- 3M Scotchgard Marine Liquid Wax
- Wax Applicator Pads

**Application**
- Using wax applicator pads, apply Finesse-It to remove light to medium gelcoat oxidation. This leaves behind a glazed finish. 
- Follow up with a polish (Liquid Wax) for a deep gloss appearance.  

Tip: To avoid damaging the gelcoat and effectively protect it, apply very little Finesse-It and a lot of wax.
