## Yearly Exterior Maintenance 

The yearly exterior maintenance includes:
* [Teakwood]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/maintenance-wood)
* [Topsides' paint]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/maintenance-topsides)
* [Deck's gelcoat]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/maintenance-gelcoat)
* [Deck's stainless steel]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/maintenance-steel)

Consistent yearly maintenance has real benefits over the years: Maintenance remains easy and the boat remains in great condition. People often look quite surprised when we mention that Plume is a 2002 boat, because she still looks like a fairly young lady!
