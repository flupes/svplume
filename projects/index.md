## Selected Projects
Having contributed to the construction of most of Plume’s interior and deck
equipment, we’ve undertaken countless projects. Here is just a small selection.

* [Main cabin table and cushions]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project-main-cabin-table)
* [Cockpit grate, table, and swim platform]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project-cockpit-grate)
* [Stoves and heater solution]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project-stoves)
* [Anchoring system]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project-anchors)
* [Emergency tiller]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project-emergency-tiller)
* [Canvas]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project-canvas)

## Yearly Exterior Maintenance 

The yearly exterior maintenance includes:
* [Teakwood]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/maintenance-wood)
* [Topsides' paint]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/maintenance-topsides)
* [Deck's gelcoat]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/maintenance-gelcoat)
* [Deck's stainless steel]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/maintenance-steel)

Consistent yearly maintenance has real benefits over the years: Maintenance remains easy and the boat remains in great condition. People often look quite surprised when we mention that Plume is a 2002 boat, because she still looks like a fairly young lady!
