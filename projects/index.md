## Yearly Exterior Maintenance 

The yearly exterior maintenance includes:
* [Teakwood](/projects/maintenance-wood)
* [Deck's gelcoat](/projects/maintenance-gelcoat)
* [Deck's stainless steel](/projects/maintenance-steel)
* [Topsides' paint](/projects/maintenance-topsides)

**Fun fact**: While consistently doing yearly maintenance, we do not see much difference before and after each maintenance job. We often say in French "c'est comme pisser dans un violon" (we might as well pee into a violin; meaning doing something useless). However the benefit is real over the years: Maintenance remains easy and the boat remains is great condition. People often look quite surprised when we mention that Plume is a 2002 boat, because she still looks like a fairly young lady!
