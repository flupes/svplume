### Stoves and Heater Solution 

On a small boat, every inch counts, and our galley shows just how much can fit
into limited space. In the compartment originally designed for a conventional
stove, we installed a Wallas diesel two-burner stove that doubles as a
powerful heater, an Origo gimbaled alcohol one-burner stove for cooking under
way, and a cutlery drawer. Before our trip to Mexico, we added a small
desalinator behind the Origo.

Not having an oven isn’t ideal, but it’s manageable. For instance, we baked
bread in a pressure cooker. Warm bread is always delicious, and nothing beats
the smell of freshly cooked bread filling the cabin.
