### Stoves and Heater Solution 

On a small boat, every inch counts, and our galley shows just how much can fit
into limited space. In the compartment originally designed for a conventional
stove, we installed a Wallas diesel two-burner stove that doubles as a powerful
heater, an Origo gimbaled alcohol one-burner stove for cooking under way, and a
cutlery drawer. The Origo also serves as a backup stove, for example in case of
a total loss of electrical power. Before our trip to Mexico, we added a small
water maker in the space behind the stoves.

Over the years, we’ve been pleasantly surprised by how well the Wallas performs
and how little maintenance it requires. During our 2020 refit, however, we
decided to send it in for servicing. That service quickly turned into a
replacement after the stove was badly damaged in shipping. Since responsibility
for the accident was shared between Scan Marine and us, they agreed to send
another used replacement stove. So essentially, we ended up with a “new old”
stove!

Not having an oven isn’t ideal, but it’s manageable. For instance, we baked
bread in a pressure cooker. Warm bread is always delicious, and nothing beats
the smell of freshly cooked bread filling the cabin.
