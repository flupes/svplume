### Emergency Tiller 

Fortunately, we’ve never had to use it, but just in case, we keep a homemade
emergency tiller on board. Made from mahogany and an aluminum pole (which is the dinghy mast section), it’s stored
in a locker below deck with our other emergency gear and can be fitted quickly
if the main tiller ever fails. Below are photos showing how we built it.
