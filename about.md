## About the Norsea 27 

The NØRSEA 27 has been designed by Lyle Hess in 1977. About 250 boats have been
produced using the same original mold which was used in 1979 for hull #1.

Plume was built in the Nor'Sea Yachts boatshop in Ontario (CA) managed by
Bob Eeg. 

Lyle Hess wanted a boat small enough to be trailerable, without any concession
on the seaworthiness. The reasonable size of the NØRSEA 27, its legendary
robustness, and its limited draft have been key points in our choice of a
sailboat for the San Francisco bay, and beyond if the winds are favorable[^update].

[^update] 7 years after Plume splashing, we passed the Golden Gate for a 2 year 
trip down to the Sea of Cortez.

In addition, the NØRSEA 27 is one of the only sailboat that you can get as a kit
(3 versions available to complete yourself) on the West Coast. It was important
for us to be able to monitor the quality of the work done at the boatshop and to
be able to do the finish work ourselves (money wise and to get exactly what we
wanted). Bog Eeg was kind enough to let us a full access to his boatshop and we
were working there every other weekend during six month. Beside the advantage of
having professional tools, we learned a lot form Bob and his excellent carpenter
Alonso.
