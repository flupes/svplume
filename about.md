## About the Norsea 27 

The NØRSEA 27 has been designed by Lyle Hess in 1977. About 250 boats have been
produced using the same original mold which was used in 1979 for hull #1.

Lyle Hess wanted a boat small enough to be trailerable, without any concession
to seaworthiness. The reasonable size of the NØRSEA 27, its legendary
robustness, and its limited draft were key points in our choice of a sailboat
for the San Francisco Bay, and beyond.

The NØRSEA 27 was one of the only sailboats that you can get as a kit (3
versions were available to complete yourself) on the US West Coast. It was
important for us to be able to monitor the quality of the work done at the boat
shop and to be able to do the finish work ourselves (money-wise and to get
exactly what we wanted).

Plume was built in the Nor'Sea Yachts boat shop in Ontario (California) managed
by Bob Eeg. We bought her as a Kit boat #3, which included the hull, deck, main
cabinetry, and standing rigging. Everything else was left for us to do, like
painting, trimming, plumbing, electricity, and deck equipment. Bob Eeg was kind
enough to give us full access to his boat shop and we were working there every
other weekend during six months. Besides the advantage of having professional
tools, we learned a lot from Bob and his excellent carpenter Alonso.
Furthermore, we were able to hire Alonzo for the more complex work requiring
true craftsmanship, such as the teak hatches, teak knees, storm hoods, sliding
chart table, folding table, and bowsprit.
