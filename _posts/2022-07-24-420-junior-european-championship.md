Our son Kenzo discovered sailing on our Norsea: he was only a few weeks old when
he first came aboard Plume and had already spent [two years cruising at age 6](https://photos.flupes.org/Public/Plume/Sabbatical/2009-05bCoronado-SanCarlos/i-v4Tdb8p/A).
However, his own passion has led him to competitive dinghy sailing. After a busy year of qualifying regattas around the US, he was invited along with 12 other boats from the United States to represent **Team USA** at two major events during the summer of 2022: The **420 World Championship** and the **420 Junior European Championship**. 

Having to choose between the two events, he selected the [**420 Junior European
Championship**](https://2022junioreuropeans.420sailing.org/en/default/races/race) in Vilamoura, Portugal. The event is called "european" because it is organized in Europe every year. However, 107 boats from all over the world participated (including from the USA, New Zealand, Israel, etc.). It lasted two weeks, with one week of practices and one week of regattas. Sailing at that level was a great learning experience for Kenzo. It definitely required work and discipline, but it was also a lot of fun!
