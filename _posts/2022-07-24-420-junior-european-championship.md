Our son Kenzo discovered sailing on our Norsea: he was only a few weeks old when
he first came aboard Plume and had already spent [two years cruising at age 6](https://photos.flupes.org/Public/Plume/Sabbatical/2009-05bCoronado-SanCarlos/i-v4Tdb8p/A).
However, his own passion has led him to competitive dinghy sailing.

After a busy year of qualifying regattas around the US, he was invited along with 12 other boats from the United States to represent **Team USA** at two major events during the summer of 2022: The **420 World Championship** and the **420 Junior European Championship**. 

Having to choose between the two events, he selected the [**420 Junior European
Championship**](https://2022junioreuropeans.420sailing.org/en/default/races/race) in Vilamoura, Portugal. While the event is called "european" and organized in Europe, 107 boats from all over the world participated. It lasted two weeks, with one week of practice and one week of regattas. It was an great sailing experience for Kenzo with a good balance of work, discipline, and fun.
