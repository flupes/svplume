Our son Kenzo discovered sailing on our Norsea: he was only a few weeks old when he
first came aboard Plume and has already spent two years cruising at age 6. However, his own
passion has led him to competitive dinghy sailing.

After a busy year of qualifying regattas around the US, he was invited to
represent **Team USA** at two major events during the summer of 2022: The **420
World Championship** and the **420 Junior European Championship**. 

Having to choose between the two events, he selected the **420 Junior European
Championship** in Vilamoura, Portugal. See some pictures below and on the
[official site](https://int420class.smugmug.com/2022-Galleries/2022-420-Junior-Europeans).
