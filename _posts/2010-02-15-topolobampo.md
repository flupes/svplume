The coast between Guaymas and Mazatlan has not been cruised by many boats. The
charts are off and the boating guides vague. Therefore there is a lot to be
discovered. In Topololambo for instance, after sailing the 10 mile narrow
channel boarded with breakers, we ended-up finding our own uncharted anchorage
in the delta of a small river. The village looks quite poor, but people in the
streets seem to be enjoying life peacefully.
