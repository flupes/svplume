Two of the crew members (23 month old each) did not weight much, but they took
as much room as an America’s Cup grinder! We enjoyed a small cruise from Alameda
to Sausalito with two friends, Marie and Bernard, and their toddler Loris. We
reached Sausalito in a single tack after the Bay Bridge, because the wind was
more West than usual. The 20 knots winds recorded at Angel Island were quite a
fresh welcome to this young family for a first sailing day. However, with two
reefs in the main we were still very comfortable, and the two boys had a good
nap inside. The weather was quite cold and, even in Sausalito, multiple layers
were required to enjoy the barbecued tri-tip for dinner.

On Sunday morning, we did an excursion under the Golden Gate Bridge, welcomed by
a group of dolphins, which was a magical moment. We were there right at the
slack, so the waters were not too confused. The wind was blowing a little bit
less than Saturday, so our trip downwind was quite relaxing. Everybody enjoyed
the long lunch on deck with views to San Francisco.

What we learned: Six people can fit on a Norsea 27, but at bedtime, with one
toddler in the aft cabin and one in the main cabin, there is only the cockpit
left for the adults… So prepare your warmest cloths and leave the bottle of wine
outside!
