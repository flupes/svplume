Last year it took us one month to sail from the Bay Area to Los Angeles.
Yesterday it took us 7 hours (there was a lot of traffic) to L.A. (Chino to be
precise). Of course, we did not enjoy Monterey or Santa-Barbara for 10 days on
the way, and we started more south since we departed from Cupertino ðŸ˜‰ .

_The important thing is that we left: this is a hard part!_

The last days were hectic, as usual. Shopping was intense: Saturday we tackled
West Marine, REI, Michaels Art and Crafts, Village Starionary, Kragen Auto Part,
Sears, Whole Food, FedEx. And since we did not have time to cover everything, we
continued Monday in Chino with: Trader&#8217;s Joe, ACE Hardware, AutoZone and
closed the list at 9p.m. with Fry&#8217;s Electronics&#8230; This is probably
the most horrible part when taking off: the infinite list of last minute items
that are still missing. And this is after months of minutiae planing and
shopping by Cecile! In this stupid list of stores, you may notice a new trend:
less boating (we covered the subject last year), and more car stuff. This is
because we just took possession of our new trailer! Yes, we will continue the
trip from L.A. to San Carlos towing a 2500lbs 3 axle trailer that can safely
carry Plume on the way back.
