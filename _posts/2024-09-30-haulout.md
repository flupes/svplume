This year Plume was hauled out at Svendsenâ€™s Bay Marine in Richmond, California.
While the primary task was some fresh coats of bottom paint, we also took the
opportunity to tackle maintenance and upgrades: replacing the engine intake
seacock (Plume's last original seacock and hence a potential failure point),
fitting a new prop, and servicing our Monitor windvane.

We have been using a 2-blade CDI plastic 14x10 prop until now. We were extremely
satisfied with its performance and never had any issue with it. In addition, its
price point does not prevent you to carry a spare (which we did). However, when
production was discontinued, we switched to a more traditional option: a 2-blade
Michigan bronze 13x12.

We measured boat performance before and after the prop change by recording GPS
speeds over ground at different RPMs, running reciprocal courses in the channel
in front of the boatyard to discount for current (see table below). The new prop
performed slightly better at low rpm, but the difference was not significant.
Regarding other factors like hull cleanliness, and not counting the load on the
engine (consumption), it is not possible to draw a clear conclusion (beside our
new prop is more shiny;-).
