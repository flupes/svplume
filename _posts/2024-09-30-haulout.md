This year Plume was hauled out at Svendsenâ€™s Bay Marine in Richmond, California. While the primary task was some fresh coats of bottom paint, we also took the opportunity to tackle maintenance and upgrades: replacing the engine intake seacock (Plume's last original seacock and hence a potential failure point), fitting a new prop, and servicing our Monitor windvane.

We have been using a 2-blade CDI plastic 14x10 prop until now. However, when production was discontinued, we switched to a more traditional option: a 2-blade Michigan bronze 13x12. 

We measured boat performance before and after the prop change by recording speeds at different RPMs, running reciprocal courses in the channel in front of the boatyard to discount for current. The new prop performed slightly better, but the difference was not significant. Based on this test, it is reasonable to conclude that the performance of the two props is essentially equivalent.
