It took us 8 long days to move our small 2 bedroom house into a 8ft x 16ft x 8ft
container&#8230; This was hard work since we did not realize how much has been
accumulated during the 5 years we rented our lovely home. The trucker who came
pick up our Portable On Demand Storage (PODS) asked what we had put inside: we
were grossly overweight! Here is how we did it:

Thanks to all of you who helped moving furnitures, cleaning, babysitting,
cooking and more!
