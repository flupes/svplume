Despite or thanks to the bites of the &#8220;jejenes&#8221;, San Blas is a
charming fishing town hidden between ocean and jungle. A little town where every
block has its mini-market, where you buy trash bags by the kilo, where there is
a shop to fix plastic chair by melting the plastic, where more bikes than cars
drive on the non-paved streets. And even-though the town looks pretty poor,
everyone seems to have a decent standard of living.

After anchoring Plume in the estuary, we did some tourist activities with our
friends from Tao, Estrella, and Caramelo: a jungle trip in panga to say hello to
the local crocodiles (IMPRESSIVE!), and a visit to the old fort, reminder of the
past splendor and power of San Blas. Then we spent another week living at the
local pace, wandering through the town between the plaza, the market, the bakery
(with delicious cakes)&#8230; and the hospital. Yes, unfortunately Kenzo
ended-up getting sick and in need of antibiotics: a penicillin shot twice a day!
Poor Kenzo did not really appreciate the remedy&#8230; But one thing for sure:
health care is cheap in Mexico, and seems quite effective. A couple of days
after the first shot, the little one had totally recovered and went to his first
very mexican circus!
