Last week we did a small see trial outside San Carlos. We had serious wind and
confused seas that put Plume and the crew to the test. As usual Plume sailed
fine. The crew however needed better sea legs ðŸ˜‰ We spent the 2 following days
at anchor inside the San Carlos Bay. The first night we had a serious
thunderstorm with very gusty winds and lightning for several hours. Good test
for the anchoring system and to evaluate how quickly we can disconnect our
antennas.

After a good day resting at the anchorage and visiting the nearby beach, we
finally took off for the large bay of Guaymas. This was a very welcome change
for us because we were tired of San Carlos, sounding too much like work&#8230;  
In addition, Guaymas from the sea is much more beautiful than from land!

We still had our car because we were waiting for a package in San Carlos. But we
could see that we did the switch from land to sea: the car that was a nice
convenience while working on the boat, suddenly became an annoyance (we had to
pick it up by bus, park it, etc.).

After a week, we have finished our last projects, received our package, filled
Plume with food, put the car in storage, and enjoyed pre-carnival atmosphere: we
are ready to go south!
