After loading Plume with as much food as we could, we left La Cruz marina Sunday
morning. As usual, we started with our full main and genoa at 11am, but by 2pm
we had 2 reefs and the jib. We had a very nice sail to Punta Mita on a flat sea
with short chop, similar to the conditions in the San Francisco Bay. Of course,
we had the wind right in the nose, so we had to tack several times. This was the
opportunity to get closer to the Marietas (a group a small islands at the
entrance of Banderas Bay) and catch a 4-5lbs bonito there!

The anchorage in Punta Mita was, as expected, rolly. This is definitely a spot
of interest only for the surfers. However we had a exceptional dinner aboard
with ceviche, string beans, rice, tuna fillet and strawberries for dessert.

We raised anchor a 5:30am Monday, without the engine, under a full moon. This
was a very magic moment to leave the anchorage under sail by night but with such
a nice visibility. After 2 hours the wind definitely died so we had to
motor-sail the rest of the trip (7h) to reach Chacala. We spotted 3 turtles
along the way, unfortunately one was looking very sick.

We are now anchored in the small bight of Chacala. The swell does exactly what
the guides describe: it enter the bay and makes the boat roll like crazy if you
are not oriented correctly. We thought that Easter vacation will start after
Friday, but we discovered an already crowded beach with tents everywhere. This
supposedly quiet anchorage is filled with vacationers and the music booms
everywhere. Still, the bay is lovely and we gained half a degree north in
latitude!
