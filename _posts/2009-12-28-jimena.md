We had an intense period at the end of August with the visit of Jimena to the
Sea of Cortez.

Friends were able to send us good news of Plume after the massive flooding that
devastated the San Carlos area (and a lot of other places of course). The first
pictures we got immediately after Jimena passage are visible at 
[Jimena Pictures](https://photos.flupes.org/Public/Plume/Sabbatical/2009-98Jimena/).

There would be a lot more to say about this event we lived remotely from
Switzerland, about the sailors that were less lucky than us and about all the
people of this region of Mexico that have been so damaged by Jimena. However we
missed the opportunity to publish at the time and we are now moving to another
story (even if we may still have some bad surprises when arriving on Plume).
