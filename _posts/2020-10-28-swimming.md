This summer, with pools and local beaches closed because of covid-19 or the
wildfires, we have been converting Plume into a swimming platform. We simply
take her out of the marina, anchor outside, go for a swim, and enjoy a few
peaceful hours at the anchorage while social distancing from the rest of the
world.
