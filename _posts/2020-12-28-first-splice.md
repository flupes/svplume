This year Santa brought a few marine presents, including a splicing kit. See our
first splice below on a double braided line. We are converting some unused
mooring lines, which are too short for most situations, into new dock lines.
Splicing was intimidating at first and required a little learning curve. But
once you understand the process it works like magic!
