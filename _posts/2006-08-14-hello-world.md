Plume (Web)**Log** is born.

We will be logging here both the technical aspects of Plume and her cruising
adventures. This site is mostly for ourselves and our close friends, but it is
open to anyone who shares our love of sailing and of the Norsea 27!

This log is coupled with a [Photo Gallery](https://photos.flupes.org/Public/Plume/).

We hope to be able to update this site frequently!

_CÃ©cile & Lorenzo_
