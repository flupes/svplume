After a year of qualifying events, our son Kenzo earned the honor of
representing Team USA at the **2023 420 World Championship** in Alicante, Spain.
The event brought together 130 of the worldâ€™s top sailing teams for two intense
weeks; one of practice followed by one of high-stakes racing. Against this elite
international field, Kenzo and his sailing partner Aiden put in a solid showing,
finishing 72nd overall; an excellent result at such a world-class level of
competition.
