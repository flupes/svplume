Small mexican village or gringo town? Maybe a little bit of both. At least for
the time being&#8230; as with the luxurious new marina and 50 boats at the
(choppy) anchorage, the gringo invasion is under way!

We have finally fixed our defective engine fresh water pump, spent a nice day in
Puerto Vallarta (one day is enough), and done some good re- provisioning at a
superstore. So we are ready to get out of here!
