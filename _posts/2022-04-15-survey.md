We had to complete an insurance survey this year, which resulted in a very positive report. In its final remarks, it notes: *"PLUME shows a high level of care and maintenance by knowledgeable owners; it is deemed in **Bristol condition**, a pleasure to survey!"*

The survey praises the quality of the interior and exterior finishes. Since we bought Plume as a Hull and Deck Kit 3, while we contributed significantly to the finishing work, the factory was responsible for the complex carpentry, including the teak hatches, teak knees, storm hoods, sliding chart table, folding table, bowsprit, and more. Therefore the following praise should be shared between the factory and us: *"The quality of the interior and exterior finishes is on par with a factory finished boat."* 

The survey also noted that Plume was ready for offshore cruising: *"PLUME has been outfitted for offshore cruising w/ self-steering vane, autopilot, AGM batteries, solar panel, water maker, SSB radio, chartplotter, liferaft, etc. in addition to a good set of cruising sails."*
