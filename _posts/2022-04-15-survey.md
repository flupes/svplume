We had to complete an insurance survey this year, which resulted in a very positive report. In its final remarks, it notes: *"PLUME shows a high level of care and maintenance by knowledgeable owners; it is deemed in **Bristol condition**, a pleasure to survey!"*

We bought Plume as a Hull and Deck Kit 3. While we contributed significantly to the finishing work, we commissioned the factory’s excellent carpenter to complete the more complex pieces, like teak hatches, teak knees, storm hoods, the sliding chart table, folding table, and bowsprit. The survey’s praise should therefore be shared between the factory and us: *“The quality of the interior and exterior finishes is on par with a factory-finished boat.”*

The survey also noted that Plume was ready for offshore cruising: *"PLUME has been outfitted for offshore cruising w/ self-steering vane, autopilot, AGM batteries, solar panel, water maker, SSB radio, chartplotter, liferaft, etc. in addition to a good set of cruising sails."*
