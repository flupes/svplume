We spent a few days at the anchorage in Guaymas bay, close from the marina
dinghy dock. From there, it is easy to reach downtown, the market, the bakery,
and the crowded malecon. This weekend, Guaymas was celebrating &#8220;El Día de
los Niños&#8221; with clowns, merry-go-round, and a musical and lighted
water-fountain show. Fun, specially for our little guy!

Next we headed to Bahia Santa Catalina, our last Mexican anchorage of the
season. Very scenic. Too bad the proximity of town and cargo-ships passing by
make the seashore quite polluted with garbage and gluey sand&#8230;

Finally, we set sail for San Carlos, which marked the end of our sailing trip in
Mexico&#8230; After an intense week at the marina cleaning, lowering the mast,
and preparing the boat for the road, we hauled-out and position Plume on its
brand new trailer. This first attempt was not too satisfying (the boat was not
forward enough and thus there was not enough tongue weight) so we had to come
back to the crane a few days later for some adjustments&#8230;. Plume&#8217;s
trailing adventure is only starting but already promises to be quite
interesting!
