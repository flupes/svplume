The big storm that passed over California and Arizona Thursday to Saturday
affected the weather even down here in San Carlos. From Geary&#8217;s blog on
Jan 23:

> Yesterday morning we had a report of 57 knot winds just to the north of San
> Carlos. This morning I received an email from Don on All the Way in San Carlos
> that said they had 5 sailboats and 2 powerboats on the beach with only two
> being successfully taken off so far.

In the marina we did not suffer like the poor boats that ended on the beach, but
we could not believe it would rain so much&#8230; We were really slow to wake up
and start closing the ports. Result: one of our 2 small keyboard did not survive
being filled with water&#8230;

We also discovered that 2 ports are now leaking (there were not during the
hurricane, otherwise we would have seen water marks). Unfortunately, one of them
is above the chart table: require a fix&#8230;
