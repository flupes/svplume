Today the 3 powerboats and the only sailboat left the anchorage. Maybe they felt
it was too uncomfortable: we were the only boat putting a stern anchor for the
night and it helped a lot. The 45ft powerboat next to us was exactly transverse
to the swell and it was impressive to see it rocking 25 deg back and forth every
4s!

So it is definitely Easter vacation: here they last 2 weeks! However, the playa
is full of Mexican people: we felt less annoyed than on beaches crowed with
Frenches or Gringos ðŸ˜‰ Reminiscent from what you see in the city, the beach is
patrolled by 3 heavily armed &#8220;Marina&#8221; army people&#8230; We are
wondering what they are doing here. There is also a full staff of the Mexican
red cross: not a bad idea with so many people and so much surf. In fact, Cecile
has been &#8220;rescued&#8221; by a life guard who swim to her when she was just
30m beyond the breaker line. He advised her that it was forbidden to swim so
far. To what she responded that it was less dangerous than the kids left alone
in the breakers&#8230;

Well, when Chacala returns to its quiet time, it is certainly a little paradise
with this great beach bordered by coconut trees. Currently everybody in the bay
can enjoy the disco from 7pm to 2am!
