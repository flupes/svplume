Well, almost two years since our last line&#8230; Not that we stopped working on
Plume or did not sail. Just that web presence went down on our priority list.

But now that we are going for more than a few day-sails, we ought to write
something!

So let's back up: A few months ago we made the decision to stop working
for one year and go sailing. Since then, it has been dense days to advance some
projects on Plume while remaining committed to our professional life. The plan
is to go slowly to Mexico and farther if possible. We will start with some very
gentle hops down the California coast to see how we can manage our 4 year old
with our sailing&#8230;

  * August 1st 2008: First day of our 1 year &#8220;sabbatical&#8221;. Yeah! Now
    we have to rush to take advantage of this coming year: try not to stay stuck
    with our infinite list of projects and go sailing asap.
  * August 4th: We haul out Plume for bottom paint and some other work requiring
    to be out of the water (longer stuffing box hose, new raw water intake
    valve, new transducer, and we discovered new cutless bearing).
  * August 12th: Splashed with 3 new coats of Micron 66, and lighter bank
    account! Now we have to get going to avoid growth on our bottom!
