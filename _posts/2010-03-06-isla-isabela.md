Isla Isabela is a national wildlife preserve. A paradise for frigate-birds,
brown & blue-footed boobies, iguanas, and a very rich marine life. Never before
have we been able to observe birds and nets so easily, because of their density
and the fact that they are not afraid of humans (assuming you keep reasonable
distance). They may also be used to live in harmony with the students from
Guadalaraja who come here to study land and marine wildlife.

At the island south anchorage Plume enjoys the company of three friend boats:
Tao, Estrella and Caramelo. It&#8217;s fun to hike the small island all
together.
