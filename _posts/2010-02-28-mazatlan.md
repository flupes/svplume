We are now in a big city, with a nice downtown, and a convenient anchorage (but
depending on the wind we get the smell from the sewage station&#8230;). This is
carnival and the ambiance is festive. We like shopping at the mercado and Kenzo
enjoys swimming at Isla de Piedra.

Good news: we have received a replacement EPIRB (did not function after the San
Carlos summer) from Florida so are ready to continue further south.

Bad news: we have a leak on our engine fresh water pump, so we had to order a
new one in California. We hope to receive it in San Blas in a couple of
weeks&#8230;
