Finally, we replaced Plume's full battery set: One Lifeline Starting (GPL-2400T)
for the engine and two Lifeline Deep Cycle (GPL-24T) for the house. This is a
big news, because the batteries have been sitting in their cardboards in the
garage for several months.

While Lorenzo did replace the house batteries 10 years ago (the exact same
models), this time he was reluctant to get started given how heavy the batteries
are and how challenging it is to place them in their dedicated box in the engine
compartment... without mentioning removing the old ones.

Finally we decided to put our son to contribution (for the price of a Boba
tea:-). Below is a picture of Kenzo devising the best strategy to do the job.
Thanks Kenzo for saving our backs!

*Battery on the left already prepped by raising it with a series of blocks. Just
one last huge effort combined with enough agility to follow the right path! Note
the "plank" to help with the manoeuver.*

### Technical note
  - House batteries:
    - 25.5kg (56lbs) each
    - 160Ah in parallel
  - Startign battery:
    - 24.1kg (53lbs)
    - 870 CCA
    - in retrospective, the smaller model would have been plenty and much easier
      to fit, but we just went with the original choice we made 16+ years ago
