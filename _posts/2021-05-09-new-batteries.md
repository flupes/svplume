Finally, Plume has some brand new batteries: One Lifeline Starting (GPL-2400T) for the engine and two Lifeline Deep Cycle (GPL-24T) for the house. This is a big news, because the batteries have been sitting in their cardboards in the garage for several weeks. 

While Lorenzo did replace the batteries about 10 years ago (the exact same models), this time he was reluctant to get started given how heavy the batteries are and how challenging it is to place them in their dedicated box in the engine compartment... without mentioning removing the old ones.

But then we came up with a brilliant idea: Hiring our son Kenzo for the job... for the price of a Boba tea:- Below is a picture of Kenzo putting the new batteries in place. Thanks Kenzo for saving our backs!
