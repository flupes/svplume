Before leaving Mexico, we decided to pay a visit to the Barrancas del Cobre and
its Raramuri inhabitant. So we left Plume on its trailer for a week in San
Carlos, drove to El Fuerte (6 hours away), and from there took the Chepe train
to Posada Barrancas first, and Creel next. We took the economic class to be with
the locals and cut the price by 2.5. What a fabulous trip!

Too bad it was only a week, we could easily spend a full year there&#8230; The
scenery is outstanding and quite diverse, with vast canyons, rivers, lakes,
amazing rock formations, to mention just a few. The people are quite interesting
as well, with Mexican villages next to Indian territory. From what we understand
(mostly from our readings), the Raramuri are among the rare Indians in the
Americas who have been able to preserve their traditional life style. They live
a simple and self-reliant life, being able to take from their environment their
most basic and essential foods and tools. They are not interested in
accumulating material goods. Instead, they invest in family and friends upon
whom they can rely for help and companionship. This type of value have helped
them resist the temptations of our modern industrial society so far. We wish
they will be able to continue living like their ancestors for many more years to
come!
