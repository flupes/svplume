Thanks to a strong and unusual westerly wind, we were able to sail in straight
lines over the weekend: we sailed the 35nm loop between Brisbane Marina and
Angel Island without the need to tack at an average speed of over 5.5 knots (no
engine). This made for one of the luckiest sailing conditions in Plume's
history! 

We also spent a lovely night at Alaya cove, one of our favorite coves
in the bay. A nice reward following our [yearly maintenance job](/projects).
