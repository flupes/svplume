During three intense weeks we tried to make some progress on multiple projects
while trying to <<move-in>> our small sailboat. We were growing more
anxious each time we unloaded stuff from our pickup truck on the boat and were
seeing the boat sinking more and more... Well, we are not fully loaded yet,
but now we start to be accustomed to see the new super high waterline;-) This
was a difficult period since mixing several projects with organizing our new
live aboard was not easy. Alas, we completed some items of our list.

  * Installed a flat rope roller on the stern pulpit
  * Had some welding done to mount the liferaft on the stern pulpit
  * Had a stainless steel <<faux>> boom gallow made to attach a
    navigation awning [need picture]
  * Lot of sawing for various projects [more later]
  * Added a spinnaker and a pole to our sail-robe [not flown yet]
  * Re-redo the stuffing box (back to the basic, no more drip free packing)
  * Lowered the exhaust waterlift
  * Replaced the two 105Ah flooded batteries with 2&#215;80 Ah AGM house
    batteries (<a href="http://www.lifelinebatteries.com/marinedeepcycle.php"
    target="_blank">GPL-24T</a>) + 1x870CCA AGM starting battery (<a
    href="http://www.lifelinebatteries.com/marinestartingbatteries.php"
    target="_blank">GPL-2400T</a>)
    [_switching for flooded batteries to AGM implied a series of other changes, but I knew that I did not want go cruising with moving acid in my boat_]
  * Replaced the stock alternator with one high output externally regulated
    alternator (<a href="http://www.balmar.net/Page6-6seriesalts.html"
    target="_blank">Balmar 60 Series</a>)
  * Installed a new smart regulator (<a
    href="http://www.balmar.net/page67-ars5.html" target="_blank">ARS-5</a>)
  * Replaced the old battery combiner with a combiner with real charge profile
    (<a href="http://www.balmar.net/page20-Duocharge.html"
    target="_blank">Duo-Charge</a>)
  * Replaced the old 15A battery charger with a 20A &#8211; 3 stages battery
    charger (<a

    target="_blank">Protech 1220i</a>)
  * Installed a 50W solar panel (<a

    target="_blank">Kyocera KC 50</a>) on the stern pulpit
    [_and moved the stern running light on the panel_]
  * Installed a solar panel regulator (<a

    PS-15M</a>)

Of course, our departure date has slipped a little, but even if our project list
is still very long, we are starting to see the end of the tunnel. We actually
even went for a short sail with some relatives today!
